          Workampus is a cross-platform Mobile Application which that are deployable on both Android and iOS devices.
          The system is built using flutter framework which utilize dart language. The app has type user which are job
          seeker and job provider, however, I have found that users prefer to have a single account on the system with
          the ability to switch roles between job seeker and job provider which have been implemented into this system.
          Job seeker can use this app to look for available jobs and if it is not yet existed, the job seeker can offer
          their service on this platform. For job provider, they can use this system to see find available service and
          at the same time create a job post so that it is visible for the job seeker. The system was develop using
          iterative model in software development lifecycle this is because it has the advantage of being more flexible
          which allows changes to be done by evaluating at every iteration. The selected architecture design used to
          support the system development process is Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. Furthermore, User
          Acceptance Testing (UAT) have been conducted to test the acceptance of user towards the functionality of the
          system.
